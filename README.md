title: "Motivation Analysis with PIRLS Data"
description: |
  This repository contains code to analyze and validate constructs related to "motivation" using data from the PIRLS seminar (pirls_lesson.xlsx). Specifically, it checks for a common motivation construct by examining two scales: Internal Motivation and Instrumental Motivation.

project_overview: |
  The goal of this project is to determine if there is a common underlying construct for motivation based on:
    - Internal Motivation: Measured using six items (enjoy_r1 to enjoy_r6).
    - Instrumental Motivation: Measured using six items (reason1 to reason6).
  
  Using these scales, we aim to identify if there is a single, unified construct of "motivation" or if these constructs should be treated independently.

dataset:
  file: pirls_lesson.xlsx
  description: Contains responses from a PIRLS seminar, with fields for various motivation-related questions.
  variables_of_interest:
    - enjoy_r1 to enjoy_r6: Questions related to internal motivation (e.g., enjoyment and intrinsic interest).
    - reason1 to reason6: Questions related to instrumental motivation (e.g., external reasons or goals).

analysis_approach: |
  1. Data Preparation: Load the dataset and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
  2. Construct Validation:
      - Calculate scores for Internal Motivation by averaging responses from enjoy_r1 to enjoy_r6.
      - Calculate scores for Instrumental Motivation by averaging responses from reason1 to reason6.
  3. Statistical Analysis:
      - Perform reliability analysis (e.g., Cronbach's Alpha) for each motivation type.
      - Use factor analysis or correlation analysis to assess whether the internal and instrumental motivations form a single construct or multiple constructs.

requirements:
  - pandas: For data manipulation.
  - numpy: For numerical calculations.
  - scipy or statsmodels: For statistical analysis.

installation_instructions: |
  Install all dependencies with:
    pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels

usage: |
  1. Clone this repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motivation-analysis-pirls.git
      cd motivation-analysis-pirls
  2. Place the pirls_lesson.xlsx file in the project directory.
  3. Run the analysis script:
      python analyze_motivation.py
  4. Review the output in the console or generated plots to see the motivation construct results.

results_and_interpretation: |
  The analysis will produce scores for internal and instrumental motivation, along with reliability and factor analysis results. Based on these findings, we will draw conclusions about whether "motivation" can be considered a single construct or if internal and instrumental motivations are distinct.
