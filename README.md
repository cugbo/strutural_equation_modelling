# Motivation Analysis with PIRLS Data

This repository contains code to analyze and validate constructs related to "motivation" using data from the PIRLS seminar (pirls_lesson.xlsx). Specifically, it checks for a common motivation construct by examining two scales: Internal Motivation and Instrumental Motivation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to determine if there is a common underlying construct for motivation based on:
- Internal Motivation: Measured using six items (enjoy_r1 to enjoy_r6).
- Instrumental Motivation: Measured using six items (reason1 to reason6).

Using these scales, we aim to identify if there is a single, unified construct of "motivation" or if these constructs should be treated independently.

## Dataset
- File: pirls_lesson.xlsx
- Description: Contains responses from a PIRLS seminar, with fields for various motivation-related questions.
- Variables of Interest:
  - enjoy_r1 to enjoy_r6: Questions related to internal motivation (e.g., enjoyment and intrinsic interest).
  - reason1 to reason6: Questions related to instrumental motivation (e.g., external reasons or goals).

## Analysis Approach

1. Data Preparation: Load the dataset and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
2. Construct Validation:
   - Calculate scores for *Internal Motivation* by averaging responses from enjoy_r1 to enjoy_r6.
   - Calculate scores for *Instrumental Motivation* by averaging responses from reason1 to reason6.
3. Statistical Analysis:
   - Perform reliability analysis (e.g., Cronbach's Alpha) for each motivation type.
   - Use factor analysis or correlation analysis to assess whether the internal and instrumental motivations form a single construct or multiple constructs.

## Requirements

This project uses Python with the following packages:
- pandas: For data manipulation.
- numpy: For numerical calculations.
- scipy or statsmodels: For statistical analysis.

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motivation-analysis-pirls.git
   cd motivation-analysis-pirls
   ```

2. Place the pirls_lesson.xlsx file in the project directory.

3. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analyze_motivation.py
   ```

4. Review the output in the console or generated plots to see the motivation construct results.

## Results and Interpretation

The analysis will produce scores for internal and instrumental motivation, along with reliability and factor analysis results. Based on these findings, we will draw conclusions about whether "motivation" can be considered a single construct or if internal and instrumental motivations are distinct.
